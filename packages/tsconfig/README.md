# @monholm/tsconfig

A strict TypeScript configuration base.

Expected to be used alongside eslint/typescript-eslint, and as such, config options that aren't type-related and are covered by the recommended eslint/typescript-eslint rules, are left disabled/unconfigured.
An example of this is `allowUnreachableCode` which is covered by the eslint rule `no-unreachable`.
